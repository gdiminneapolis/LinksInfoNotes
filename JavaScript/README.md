helping, writing, teaching. Pretty much everyone has gone through

want to help someone else.

## Tools, etc

* [Get Started with Debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/) - an alternative to using a lot of `console.log` statements when you're trying to figure out why your code isn't doing what you expect, or for just exploring what's happening. Don't stop using `console.log`, add this to your toolbox.

* [Interactive Regular Expression Checker](https://regexly.chipto.io/)

  This is an interesting site: it will show you what sorts of things
  will be matched by a regular expression in JavaScript.
