"I" below.


* [**Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13590009-think-like-a-programmer)
  by V. Anton Spraul.

  Spraul's purpose in this book is not to teach you how to write a
  program, but to begin to understand the problem-solving approach
  that is inherent in good programmers. Like so many skills,
  programming is driven by the desire and vision of the
  practitioner. A painter uses brushes, canvas, paints, other media to
  create a work of art, but it isn't the tools, it isn't the specific
  techniques, and it isn't even the particular skill the painter has
  that makes a good work of art; it is their composition, the melding
  of media and surface, the use of different techniques, and practice
  in developing the skills that come together to form the work of
  art. Spraul is going to take you deeper than just the syntax,
  semantics, and data structures of software to the heart of what
  makes a good programmer: the ability to creatively find and generate
  solutions to problems.

* [**Learn to Program**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520.Learn_to_Program)
  by Chris Pine.

  This book is nearly universally recommended to people new to programming. The
  original tutorial is available online for free as well:
  [https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). _Learn
  to Program_
  was featured on the great webcomic
  [Unshelved](http://www.unshelved.com/2014-7-25).

* [**A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language)
  by Christopher Alexander.

  You may be wondering why I've included a book on building
  construction. The answer is quite simple: the concepts in building
  towns and houses is nearly directly translatable to building
  software applications and systems. One part of being an excellent
  craftsperson is being able to apply abstract learning in different
  problem domains. If you are an expert in writing software, you are
  almost *never* going to be solving problems only for other software
  developers. (You can and should do so, but the client and users are
  generally non-programmers.) Thus you're most likely going to be
  working in someone else's domain of expertise. Alexander's views on
  architecture apply to software architecture as well.

* [**Beautiful Code**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do) by Andy Oram and Greg Wilson.

  A book with a purpose, that isn't a how to code, so much as a how to
  think about coding. Source of the missive:

  1. Make it correct
  2. Make it pretty
  3. Make it fast

  In that order

## JavaScript-specific

* [**JavaScript: The Good Parts**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2998152-javascript)
  by David Crockford.

  JavaScript is a vast, sprawling language and ecosystem, and has been
  maligned for much poor code on the web. Crockford extracts out the
  parts that are really useful, giving the reader a better
  grounding. This book is the progenitor of many of the JavaScript
  frameworks that have come up the past few years, including
  CoffeeScript, TypeScript and other *Script derivatives.

* [**You Don't Know JS series**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
  by [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify).

  A *tour de force* by one of the great teachers and evangelists of
  JavaScript, Kyle's "You Don't Know JS" series is a must-read
  collection of books. You can get the books in raw form on-line at
  the above address, and you can get the published e-books at your
  favourite vendor.

* [**Eloquent Javascript**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn
  Haverbeke.

  When I was more naive about JS, I wrote a bit of a negative review
  of this book. Subsequently, I've learned of it's true eloquence and
  meaning in giving a model of how to organize and implement modern
  JS. The subtitle "A modern introduction to programming" is still a
  bit misleading, perhaps, because you have to understand a fair bit
  of JavaScript *and* programming to get the message, I feel. But
  that's just a quibble at this point. Read this before you strike out
  on creating a client-based JS application; you won't regret it.

## HTML and CSS Specific

* [The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout)
  by [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/).

  This new book by CSS3 Grid contributor Rachel Andrew is the current
  best explanation and introduction to the new layout systems in CSS3,
  Grid and Flexbox. A *must* read!

* [**HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites**](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) by Jon Duckett.

  This book has been recommended by several people in the [GDI] courses
  I've been helping in. A very visual approach, using full-colour photographs
  to explain the two declarative languages.

## PHP Specific

* [**Head-First PHP and MySQL**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006303.do)

  Published by O'Reilly, their "Head-First" imprint is intended for
  people just starting out learning to program. *Head-First PHP and
  MySQL* is an entertaining and informative dive into one of the most
  popular server-side programming languages. After learning HTML, CSS,
  and some JavaScript, PHP is a great place to jump into writing
  dynamic web sites that interact with your own data. WordPress,
  running on 28% of the web (and still growing) is written in PHP.

## Ruby-specific

* [**Eloquent Ruby**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby)
  by Russ Olsen.

  Olsen's approach in this book is to go far beyond just learning a
  programming language, but a way to learning the idioms and the "Ruby
  Way". Even if your chosen language is something other than Ruby,
  reading this book will give you an appreciation for how to delve
  into a language and get the most out of it.

* [**Confident Ruby**](http://www.confidentruby.com/) by Avdi Grimm.

  More than any other book I've read on Ruby, "Confident Ruby" has
  affected my coding habits more than any other. If Ruby is about
  making programmers happy, *Confident Ruby* is about making
  programming joyful, and not just in the immediate, but being able to
  look at code you've written in the future and recall the
  joy. *Confident Ruby* seeks to combat software rot from the get-go.

* [**Well-Grounded Rubyist**](http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692)
  by David A. Black

  Also known as the "Black Book" (because of the author's name), WGR
  is the successor to _Ruby for Rails_ by Black that provided me with
  the much-needed introduction to how to write Ruby code, with the
  idea of using it in Ruby for Rails. This book is a fabulous primer
  on the Ruby idioms and expressions that help make one a good Ruby
  programmer.

* [**Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby**](http://www.poodr.com/)
  by Sandi Metz

  This book provides a deeply-needed introduction to object-oriented
  design, specifically targeted to the Ruby language. Ruby is one of
  the richest languages in which to express object-oriented patterns,
  but it is easy to fall of the OO wagon and start to get things
  messed up. Sandi provides the thinking tools necessary to decide how
  to structure your code for better maintainability, extensibility and
  testability. Comprehension and forward communication of the choices
  made during software design are crucial to programming, and Sandi is
  one of the very best at explaining things.

## Rails-specific

* [**Rails 4 in Action**](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/) by Ryan Bigg,
  Yehuda Katz, Steve Klabnik, and Rebecca Skinner.

  A follow-on the highly successful Rails 3 in Action, R4iA has been
  completely rewritten, with new examples, case study, and all the
  great new features in Rails 4.

  A great book for beginning Rails developers to start with, and for
  intermediate developers to step up their game.

* [**Practicing Rails**](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/)
   by [Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com).

  The first chapter alone (free!) is worth a download and very
  thorough read. Justin has provided one of the most effective
  strategies for learning just about *anything* skill based, and it's
  especially effective for learning software skills. The focus of the
  book and the examples and such are obviously Rails, but the first
  chapter is applicable to learning anything.

## Object-Oriented Programming

* [**99 Bottles of OOP**](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles) by
  Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen.

  A recent book, representing the absolute best by two teachers of
  software engineering. Sandi has been teaching Object-oriented
  programming for decades, and Katrina brings in her expertise with
  refactoring, resulting in a deep book that stretches beyond the
  basics and deep into the structures and understanding of object
  systems and idioms. It brings up to date the actual concepts of
  refactoring, test-driven development, naming things, reducing code
  "smells" and making code more easily and economically maintainable
  and sustainable. They take all the buzzwords and unbuzzify them into
  practical, useful methodologies and techniques.
