ladies! I am a little stuck. I am about to be an independent contractor, they asked my hourly rate… A friend told me $75/hour but I think that’s way too much? I have about 5 years experience and will be making existing components “more interactive” and will also be a part of the UX decision making for those changes. Probably lots of SCSS and JS. How much would YOU charge if you were me?

R1: there are some good salary estimating websites out there that might help provide context, too - Glassdoor, Comparably, Simply Hired.

R2: I think you should ask $75 at least, but be willing to negotiate. If this is through an agency chances are that's too high, but if you're independent, that's a good rate.

OP: It is independent! Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:

R3: I charge $60 an hour, but I have many of my clients on special deals. I have a “friends and family” rate of $30 an hour I use for my favorite clients and not for profits.

R4: I have similar experience and have charged $75 for the last year or two
